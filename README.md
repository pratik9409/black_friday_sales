We can observe that purchase amount is repeating for many customers.This may be because on Black Friday many are buying discounted products in large numbers and kind of follows a Gaussian Distribution.

Occupation has at least 20 different values. Since we do not known to each occupation each number corresponds, is difficult to make any analysis. Furthermore, it seems we have no alternative but to use since there is no way to reduce this number.
